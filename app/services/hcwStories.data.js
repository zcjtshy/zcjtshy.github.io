    story: `Around Feb 2020 I experienced bouts of anxiety over my final year thesis and future plans. It made me feel breathless and made my heart beat raise. It was different from other times I had felt anxious, which was mostly feelings of butterflies in my stomach. With my 2020 anxiety, it was more physiological and I couldnâ€™t just shrug it off. My relic reminding me of these times is my yoga mat, an accidental encounter that helped me through my anxiety. Practicing 30 days of yoga with a YouTuber called Adriene helped me regulate my heart rate and breath. I felt more in control when I experienced anxiety. It helped me just enough to cope and get through.`
